# Zeyad Elhodaiby — Resume Website

Simple static resume site. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view. To produce a printable PDF, use the browser Print dialog and choose "Save as PDF".

Quick steps (macOS):

1. Open in default browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

2. Print to PDF: File → Print → Save as PDF

Files:

- `index.html` — resume content
- `styles.css` — styling and print rules

If you want adjustments (colors, layout, export to PDF programmatically, or deployment), tell me what you'd like changed.
